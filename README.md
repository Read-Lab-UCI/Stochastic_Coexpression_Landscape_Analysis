# Compute_Rate_Matrix_Python
Quick python version of rate matrix calculation code

Requires Python 3.6 (Anaconda ideally)

Uses: Numpy, Scipy, Pandas and Numba

Written mainly to avoid having to depend on matlab licenses, so far all models/parameter sets tested are done about 2x as fast as matlab but more testing needs to be done. 

Still very much a WIP, only contains one model (MISA Ex) and each new parameter set of a trial overwrites the previous one.
